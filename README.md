# hacker-sounds

This Visual Studio Code extension automatically turns you into a very skilled hacker by playing movie-like sounds while you write code.

## How to use

Hacker Sounds will start immediately when Visual Studio Code is started. However, you can enable and disable the extension by executing these commands in the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P).

- `Hacker Sounds: Enable`
- `Hacker Sounds: Disable`

## Known Issues & Bugs

The extension is in a very early stage. It still has not been tested in Windows and the sounds could be greatly improved.
